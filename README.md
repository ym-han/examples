Forked from https://github.com/talonvoice/examples
Spiced with a mix of https://github.com/dwighthouse/talonvoice-scripts  https://github.com/lexjacobs/talon_user and https://github.com/tabarat/talon_user

**Please do not bother with my fork, at least not for now. I am not actively maintaining the public version, and I haven't made any interesting technical innovations on it. I'm also not a programmer.**

The few suggestions I have for those starting out with Talon are non-technical. They include:

1. Using 'oh' instead of 'phrase'
2. Using the pithier 'line' instead of 'sentence'
3. Lette replacements (have not tried on beta):
k -> kim
 w -> woke
 h -> ham
 m -> met
 f -> fin
 j -> jug
 d -> din
 g -> gig
